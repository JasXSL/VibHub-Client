# VibHub-Client
A client for remote controlled adult toys, using node and a raspberry pi.

This is a work in progress. The instructions will teach you how to set it up on a breadboard. I'm looking into options for making a pre-assembled kit, but don't expect any news on that soon.

## Assemble the HARDWARE!

Here's what you'll need to build this from scratch.

1. **A raspberry Pi**. This guide will assume you're using a Zero W. Other models will work, but only verison 3 and zero W have built in bluetooth and wifi. Other versions will require a wireless adapter.
2. **Generic equipment to make your pi run**: SD card, Power supply.
3. **Lab cables** at least 7, of which all are M/M for pi zero (W), or 4 M/F for any other model.
4. **A breadboard**, a tiny one will work. You can obviously just use some wire and solder it on directly, but this guide will show how to wire it on a breadboard.
5. **A Vibrating USB-Connected Toy**. USB ports are limited to 500mA, so all should work unless they're shoddy quality. I use one from the iSex series while developing this.
6. **A Female USB connector**.
7. **An L293D motor controller chip**. You can use another chip so long as it's rated high enough, but for the tutorial I'll be using the common LD293D.
